# Kodee_Assignment
This project is a simple weather app developed using C#, HTML and CSS. As a user you're able to lookup current temperature, maximum expected daily temperature, 
and minimum expected daily temperature using City and/or ZIP Code. You're also able to look up historical weather temperature for ZIP code searches done with the app,
and sort those records by time or ZIP code. Temperature in the app is provided in fahrenheit. 

To run the app simply clone this repository, open the project solution using Visual Studio, and run the app.
